- When?

I dit it today.
Yesterday I experience some allergic reactions to javascript so I read my UX book to prepare my upcoming watch. Today I started by listening to Seppe's solution to this project and started my own. Tried to make it as simple as possible.

- How?

Watched 'the coding train' with his 'create snake game' challenge.
Looked at other students code.
Listened to Seppe.
Divided the task into bits as small as possible.
Googled the bits.
Console logged my attempts in creating the bits.
Came up with a simple but kick ass working version of the assignment.

- Who?

Moi.

1. HTML & CSS: done
2. Javascript: done
3. Readme: done
4. All must haves are done, nice to haves not (still trying to make JavaScript love me back but so far no luck so I'm taking baby steps that I understand and can execute to try and win her heart).
